  <p>The Teacher's Estate is a private housing estate, named so because it was an area where government school teachers lived. This area have very interesting street names. All of the street names were named after an Asian philosopher and poet. In total, there are 7 historical figures that the roads were named after. Here's a list of them.</p>
<p><strong>Omar Khayyam Avenue - named after Ghiyath ad-Din Abu I-Fath Omar Ibn Ibrahim Khayyam Neishapuri also known as Omar Khayyam</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3103 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/39123_Omar-khayyam-270x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="244" />1048-1131 AD</p>
<p>Born in Nishapur, in northeastern Iran, at a young age he moved to Samarkand and obtained his education there. Afterwards he moved to Bukhara and became established as one of the major mathematicians and astronomers of the Islamic Golden Age. He wrote one of the most important treatises on algebra written before modern times, the Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra (1070) which includes a geometric method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a hyperbola with a circle. He contributed to a calendar reform.</p>
<p>His significance as a philosopher and teacher, and his few remaining philosophical works, have not received the same attention as his scientific and poetic writings. Al-Zamakhshari referred to him as "the philosopher of the world". He taught the philosophy of Avicenna for decades in Nishapur.</p>
<p>Outside the Persian speaking world, Khayyám has influenced literature and societies through the translation of his works and popularization by other scholars. The greatest such effect was in English-speaking countries. The English scholar Thomas Hyde (1636–1703) was the first non-Persian known to have studied his works. The most influential, however, was Edward FitzGerald (1809–83), who made Khayyám famous in the West through his translation and adaptations of Khayyám's quatrains (Persian: رباعیات‎‎ rubāʿiyāt) in the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Li Po Avenue - named after Li Bai also known as Li Po</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3104 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/libai-206x300.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="220" />701-762 AD</p>
<p>Around a thousand poems attributed to him are extant. His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty poetry anthology Heyue yingling ji, compiled in 753 by Yin Fan, and thirty-four of his poems are included in the anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, which was first published in the 18th century.</p>
<p>In the same century, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. The poems were models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking wine. Among the most famous are "Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day", "The Hard Road to Shu", and "Quiet Night Thought", which still appear in school texts in China.</p>
<p>In the West, multi-lingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made. His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness, chivalry, and the well-known fable that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon’s reflection in the river.</p>

<p><strong>Kalidasa Avenue - named after Kalidasa</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3105 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/kalidasa-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="102" height="122" />5th Century CE</p>
<p>Kālidāsa (Sanskrit: कालिदासः) was a Classical Sanskrit writer, widely regarded as the greatest poet and dramatist in the Sanskrit language. His plays and poetry are primarily based on the Indian Puranas.</p>
<p>Much about his life is unknown, only what can be inferred from his poetry and plays. His floruit cannot be dated with precision, but most likely falls within the 5th century CE.</p>
<p>See Wikipedia about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa">Kalidasa</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tung Po Avenue - named after Su Shi also known as Su Tungpo</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3106 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/sushitungpo-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="178" />1037-1101 AD</p>
<p>Su Shi, also known as Su Tungpo, was a Chinese writer, poet, painter, calligrapher, pharmacologist, gastronome, and a statesman of the Song dynasty. A major personality of the Song era, Su was an important figure in Song Dynasty politics, aligning himself with Sima Guang and others, against the New Policy party led by Wang Anshi. Su Shi was famed as an essayist, and his prose writings lucidly contribute to the understanding of topics such as 11th-century Chinese travel literature or detailed information on the contemporary Chinese iron industry.</p>
<p>His poetry has a long history of popularity and influence in China, Japan, and other areas in the near vicinity and is well known in the English-speaking parts of the world through the translations by Arthur Waley, among others. In terms of the arts, Su Shi has some claim to being "the pre-eminent personality of the eleventh century." Dongpo pork, a prominent dish in Hangzhou cuisine, is named in his honor.</p>

<p><strong>Tagore Avenue - named after Rabrindanath Tagore</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-3107 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/tagore5-220x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="300" />1861-1941</p>
<p>Rabindranath Tagore was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal".</p>
<p>A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.</p>
<p>Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tu Fu Avenue - named after Du Fu also known as Tu Fu</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-3108 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/800px-Dufu-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="252" />712-720 AD</p>
<p>Du Fu was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty. Along with Li Bai (Li Po), he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets. His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant, but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations. His life, like the whole country, was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755, and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest.</p>
<p>Although initially he was little-known to other writers, his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture. Of his poetic writing, nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages.</p>
<p>He has been called the "Poet-Historian" and the "Poet-Sage" by Chinese critics, while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as "the Chinese Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Shakespeare, Milton, Burns, Wordsworth, Béranger, Hugo or Baudelaire".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Iqbal Avenue - named after Allama Iqbal also known as Sir Muhammad Iqbal</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-3109 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/Iqbal-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300" />1877-1938</p>
<p>Allama Iqbal (علامہ اقبال), widely known as Muhammad Iqbal, was a poet, philosopher, and politician, as well as an academic, barrister and scholar in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is called the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan ". He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with literary work in both the Urdu and Persian languages.</p>
<p>Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet by Pakistanis,Iranians and other international scholars of literature. Though Iqbal is best known as an eminent poet, he is also a highly acclaimed "Muslim philosophical thinker of modern times". His first poetry book, Asrar-i-Khudi, appeared in the Persian language in 1915, and other books of poetry include Rumuz-i-Bekhudi, Payam-i-Mashriq and Zabur-i-Ajam. Amongst these, his best known Urdu works are Bang-i-Dara, Bal-i-Jibril, Zarb-i Kalim and a part of Armughan-i-Hijaz. Along with his Urdu and Persian poetry, his Urdu and English lectures and letters have been very influential in cultural, social, religious and political disputes.</p>
<p>In 1922, he was knighted by King George V, granting him the title "Sir". While studying law and philosophy in England, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All-India Muslim League. Later, during the League's December 1930 session, he delivered his most famous presidential speech known as the Allahabad Address in which he pushed for the creation of a Muslim state in Northwest India.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least, our very own...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Munshi Abdullah Avenue - named after Abdullah Abdul Kadir also known as Munshi Abdullah</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3110 alignleft" src="/uploads/2017/08/munsyi.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="255" />1796-1854</p>
<p>Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir (Arabic: عبد الله بن عبد القادر 'Abd Allāh bin 'Abd al-Qādir) also known as Munshi Abdullah, was a Malayan writer of Indian origin. He was a famous Malacca-born Indian munshi of Singapore and died in Jeddah, a part of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Munshi Abdullah is regarded as the most cultured Malay who ever wrote, one of the greatest innovators in Malay letters and the father of modern Malay literature.</p>
<p>The term Munshi means "teacher" or "educator". Munshi Abdullah was a great-grandson of a Hadhrami Arab trader, and also had Tamil and to a smaller extent, Malay ancestry. Owing to his ethnic and religious background, the Malays would refer to him as a Jawi Peranakan or Jawi Pekan.</p>
<p>Munshi Abdullah followed his father's career path as a translator and teacher of colonial officials in the Malay Archipelago, mainly the British and the Dutch.</p>
<p>J.T. Thomson, a contemporary of Abdullah, described him thus: "In physiognomy he was a Tamilian of southern Hidustan: slightly bent forward, spare, energetic, bronze in complexion, oval-faced, high-nosed, one eye squinting outwards a little. He dressed in the usual style of Malacca Tamils. Acheen seluar, check sarong, printed baju, square skull cap and sandals. He had the vigour and pride of the Arab, the perseverance and subtility of the Hindoo - in language and national sympathy only was he a Malay."</p>
<p>Well, it looks like ethnic Indians who consider themselves Malay is not a new phenomenon.</p>
