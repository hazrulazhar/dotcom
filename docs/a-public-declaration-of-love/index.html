          <div class="split-bio">
  <p>I am not someone who typically blogs about my personal life, and if anything, my most mentionable public displays of affection are on Facebook, where if anything, the perspectives are private. I am someone deeply driven by love. I do things because I love doing them. And most of all, because I am in love.</p>
<p>Those who know me, especially my siblings, would know the destructive nature when my heart was crushed before, many years back. It took a long time coming for me to find the one true love who has captured my heart 4 years back. And despite the trials and tribulations we have faced together, of the many challengers for her or me that came by, eventually, we always stay together.</p>
<p>Each one that came was a bigger test than the last. And I let Allah decide if this was for me. When I was astray, I know that she had every reason to leave me. Very good reasons to, and at the end of the day, she still came back. It was my last test and I have tempted fate at least 3 times just to ensure that this is what Allah has in store for me.</p>
<p>Every time, she came back.</p>
<p>It was then that I realised, and felt his blessings and grace, that this is what He has chosen for me. I want her, I really do. I love her extremely. And I took the courage to tempt fate, at the risk of a broken heart, and she came back.</p>
<p>When faced with challenges that I did not create and control, I persevered for her. She asked me to promise that I would. And yet, despite the challengers that had the audacity to challenge my fate with her, she still chose me.</p>
<p>Sayang, I dedicate this to you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Mohabbatein of a star and her sky</span></strong></p>
<p>4 summers ago, a breath of fresh air whizzed past<br />
The branches rustle and the birds sing<br />
It made me smile alas<br />
And my heart a-glowing</p>
<p>If I could describe how I feel<br />
Or figure what made me love her<br />
I can only say that it was God's will<br />
That joined us together</p>
<p>An unexpected twist of fate,<br />
God willed and I took it by the scruff<br />
Finally finding my soulmate<br />
Someone I want who reciprocated my love</p>
<p>You, my joy who made me tear<br />
Whose fragance like milk and frangipani<br />
Your heart I conquer<br />
The desire of men a-many</p>
<p>4 summers long, I spent with you<br />
Alive my senses feel<br />
Your love for me forever true<br />
No man shall ever steal</p>
<p>Jaan. Your heart cures when I'm here<br />
Joy together. Miserable apart.<br />
Praise Allah, the Creator<br />
Alhamdulillah for the Mohabbat</p>
<p>My children who will one day read this. When you grow up, remember how much I love your mother and how much she loves me. Never find someone whose love cannot match the one I hold for your mother. And love as much as your mother does for me.</p>
