          <div class="split-bio">
  <p>In May 2015, I applied to join <a href="http://accelerator.mymagic.my/en/asean/">MAP</a>, an accelerator programme by MaGiC.</p>
<blockquote><p>A program to accelerate startups to be investment-ready in 4 months, and to build a strong ASEAN startup community by cultivating ASEAN relationships</p></blockquote>
<p>This was the first time I decided to apply for an accelerator and funding from VCs. We had to post a 90 second elevator pitch on Youtube along with an online submission about our startup. Out of 1047Â applicants, 50 were shortlisted for a final interview. <a href="https://rezkii.com">Rezkii</a> was one of those shortlisted.</p>

<p>The elevator pitch was something I found challenging. Firstly, I had to make what I do concise yet impactful. Secondly, I'm known to be a long-winded person. Going through an hour and a half of writing and taping my script was tedious. But eventually, I managed to keep it within 90 secs.</p>
<p>Next, I had to deliver a presentation.</p>

<p>I flew into KL and took a cab to Cyberjaya. Perhaps I should have Uber-ed instead. I registered my attendance, and waited. Apparently, I was the last to present. It was really stressful waiting so I rehearsed my presentation in my head over and over again.</p>
<p>Once it was my turn, I delivered my presentation. I felt I did well enough presenting with the slides. But the Q&amp;A was probably what killed me. I think I struggled answering questions and this is where I wished my team was around and helped to answer some of these questions.</p>
<p>Examples of such questions and remarks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is already <em>Competitor A</em> and <em>Competitor B.</em> Why is yours so different?</li>
<li>It seems like you're trying to do too much. I'm not sure about this.</li>
<li>You look more like a lifestyle business. It doesn't look like it can scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't feel like I convinced the panelists with my poorly thought out answers. I've never been good at responding off the cuff. I'm a thinker and contemplate my answers in the next hour.</p>
<p>Thus, it was best to present to as many people as possible before coming so that we can generate those questions and come out with answers. We would be more prepared.</p>
<p>The problem was, I wasn't prepared for the questions. I did not expect them. And that's probably why I didn't get selected.</p>
<p>When they delivered the news of who made it, I found that there was another applicant from Singapore who had a similar e-commerce idea get selected. I did not see much difference between my product and theirs. Why did they get selected?</p>
<p>I realised that the following rules apply when you are seeking for funding or to join an accelerator programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your product must scale. It must be XaaS. (X = software, logistics, marketing etc)</li>
<li>You must be able to answer why you are better than your competitors.</li>
<li>You must be able to prove demand for your product despite the competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>These learning points helped us to improve on our decks and presentations. Certainly we're better prepared for questions.</p>
