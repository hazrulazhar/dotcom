      <description>When I go to the coffeeshop to order a cup of coke, I am greeted by a China-girl, who can&#39;t speak an inch of English, and tried to mouth back my order in barely comprehensible mainland Mandarin. The local prata shop staff which resides in the coffeeshop, is constantly frustrated at her, to the point of bad-mouthing in terms I can only say are ungracious. They&#39;ve tried so hard to communicate, telling her in English, that the used plates are to be placed inside the bin, not on their counters, but to no avail.</description>

      <description>This would be a basi entry coz Ramadan was so 5 days ago. But I wanted to blog about the time I spent roaming around Geylang with Crystal and her friends. The only reason why I had not written about it was because I didn&#39;t snap enough good pics on those days, and for the life of me, I can&#39;t seem to remember one of her friend&#39;s name.
But I&#39;ll write about it anyway.</description>
