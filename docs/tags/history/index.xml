      <description>The last stand
The enemy shelled relentlessly. &#34;Tuan! Peluru dah habis tuan!&#34;, shouted a private. Charlie company had ran out of ammo.Â Lieutenant Adnan knew the inevitable. They were outnumbered 10 to 1. The 1st and 2nd Regiment gave everything they had, frustrating the Japs, pushing them back to Reformatory Road. But the moment of no return had come. Lieutenant Adnan had a choice to make. It would be untruthful to say that he was glad to make that choice.</description>

      <description>I find that I know so little about Singapore and it&#39;s hidden finds. Last Friday, I had my Friday prayers in a little known mosque hidden deep inside the private estates of Eunos. Masjid Al Abdul Razak appears to be a mosque of much history, with a architecture that resembles Yemeni/Saudi culture fused with less modern materials like zinc for a rustic, kampong feel.
Masjid Al Abdul Razak, a priceless heritage</description>
