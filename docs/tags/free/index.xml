      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a learning journey and just picking up Python properly. It isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I was introduced to Python or Django. My ex-colleague, Hong introduced it to me ages ago back in 2008. That was also when Django started. I was still very much a PHP man then. Still is now. At my current company, Python is used heavily. The syntax is similar to Ruby, but somehow has a PHP feel to it.</description>
