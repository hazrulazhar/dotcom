      <description>Now I&#39;ve been getting questions about this app. Everyone&#39;s wondering where can they find it. The bad news is, not so soon. I don&#39;t have a place to host this yet. The good news is, I created a screencast so that people can preview the power of Google Maps + a little bit of ingenuity from yours truly.
I hope this video will help you to visualise what SPPL is about.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve finished coding SPPL version 1.0. This is the Beta which I completed in a matter of 3 or 4 days. This application allows the user to search for the nearest mosque or musolla from his specified location. If you&#39;re a forgetful klutz like I am, or get intimidated by tall buildings or is in a huff but is not familliar with the area and so have no idea where the nearest prayer place is, SPPL is for you!</description>
