      <description>The last stand
The enemy shelled relentlessly. &#34;Tuan! Peluru dah habis tuan!&#34;, shouted a private. Charlie company had ran out of ammo.Â Lieutenant Adnan knew the inevitable. They were outnumbered 10 to 1. The 1st and 2nd Regiment gave everything they had, frustrating the Japs, pushing them back to Reformatory Road. But the moment of no return had come. Lieutenant Adnan had a choice to make. It would be untruthful to say that he was glad to make that choice.</description>
