      <description>I am not someone who typically blogs about my personal life, and if anything, my most mentionable public displays of affection are on Facebook, where if anything, the perspectives are private. I am someone deeply driven by love. I do things because I love doing them. And most of all, because I am in love.
Those who know me, especially my siblings, would know the destructive nature when my heart was crushed before, many years back.</description>
