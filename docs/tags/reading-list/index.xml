      <description>Edited by Ooi Kee Beng and Wan Hamidi Hamid, this book is a collection of essays, some anecdotal, others academic, of the viewpoints of ordinary Malaysians who identify themselves as Malay, on their life stories that shaped their perspectives in growing up in a multi-cultural nation, whilst coming to terms with their ethnic identity that forces them into boxes.
I picked up this book in Penang, at the GerakBudaya bookstore, apparently quite famous among those who read Malaysian literature.</description>
