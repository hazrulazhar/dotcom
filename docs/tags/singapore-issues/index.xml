      <description>Several years ago I shared how the government would back a Malay candidate for President after Nathan. The 2011 PE was an all Tan affair. However, the recent EP Commission has made clear the government&#39;s intention of a minority president from time to time.
Traditionally, Speakers of Parliament would likely be proposed as presidential candidates. Thus, since Abdullah Tarmugi and Halimah Yaacob&#39;s appointments as Speaker, I had been expecting one of them to be backed by government as their choice for President.</description>
