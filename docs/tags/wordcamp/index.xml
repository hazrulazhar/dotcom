Ladies and Gentlemen
Esteemed guests, from Singapore and overseas.
Thank you very much for helping us make history. You are the first attendees to Singapore&#39;s inaugural WordCamp.
Before I begin, I would like you to spend a moment asking yourselves this question. Why are you here? What are you doing right now? Are you blogging? Updating your Facebook? Sending a tweet? Checking in? What are you doing?</description>
