<p>Now I've been getting questions about this app. Everyone's wondering where can they find it. The bad news is, not so soon. I don't have a place to host this yet. The good news is, I created a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ia_KKVoB5EA">screencast</a> so that people can preview the power of Google Maps + a little bit of ingenuity from yours truly.</p>
<p>I hope this video will help you to visualise what SPPL is about.</p>
