<p>Great concept. I apply it in my daily life. The book seems to reiterate the Why in every chapter though. There is some extrapolation of the Golden Circle but it keeps coming back to Why. Probably the author's way of emphasising it's importance.</p>
<p>The stories are a bit long and may seem to look like fluff. But there's actually meat on this book. Just that the simple concept would take better articulation to present its points.</p>
<p>I gave a 4 star rating nevertheless, because there were plenty of stories that are inspiring. But if I were to be brutal, a 3-star rating would have been sufficient. Still, a great book to begin on any journey.</p>
