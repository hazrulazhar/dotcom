<p>Edited by Ooi Kee Beng and Wan Hamidi Hamid, this book is a collection of essays, some anecdotal, others academic, of the viewpoints of ordinary Malaysians who identify themselves as Malay, on their life stories that shaped their perspectives in growing up in a multi-cultural nation, whilst coming to terms with their ethnic identity that forces them into boxes.</p>
<p>I picked up this book in Penang, at the GerakBudaya bookstore, apparently quite famous among those who read Malaysian literature. I was attracted to the book title as the topic interests me. I'd like to know theÂ kind of similarities and differences between the Malaysian perspective, and my own Singaporean experience.</p>
<p>Much of the book is an easy read. If you're into anthropological issues of the Nusantara, this would be a good book to read to gain some insights.</p>
