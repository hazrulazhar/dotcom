I've been on a learning journey and just picking up Python properly. It isn't the first time I was introduced to Python or Django. My ex-colleague, Hong introduced it to me ages ago back in 2008. That was also when Django started. I was still very much a PHP man then. Still is now. At my current company, Python is used heavily. The syntax is similar to Ruby, but somehow has a PHP feel to it. Kinda like a mix between the two for some reason.

For those interested in learning Python, here's a list of learning material you can use.

- [Stavro's Learning Python in 10 minutes](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/)
- [After Hours Programming's Python Tutorial](https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/editors/)
- [Mark Pilgrim's Dive into Python 3](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/)
