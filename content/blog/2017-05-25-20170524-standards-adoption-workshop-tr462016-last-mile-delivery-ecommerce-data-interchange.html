<p>I was the final speaker for the workshop standing among other contemporaries in the Logistics Tech industry. I recounted our experience adopting the TR46 standard into our TMS and elaborated the productivity gains as a result of the standards adoption. Many attendees later asked me questions on adopting the standards and the application of last mile technology in their processes.</p>
