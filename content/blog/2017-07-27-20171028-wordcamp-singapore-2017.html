<p>I've submitted my proposal to speak at WordCamp Singapore 2017 and hopefully accepted, I'll give insights into the State of the Woo regionally and globally.</p>
<p>Date: Saturday, 28 October 2017<br />
Time: TBC<br />
Venue: Suntec City Convention Centre</p>
<p>Topic Title: How WooCommerce is being disrupted by Shopify and why it will rapidly lose market share</p>
<p>Topic Description: WooCommerce is the most deployed eCommerce shopping cart platform in the world. But catching up closely is the world's most popular hosted eCommerce shopping cart - Shopify.</p>
<p>Although WooCommerce is younger and raced ahead due to the dominance of the WordPress platform, its pervasiveness is being dealt a serious challenge by Shopify with its simplicity and adaptability to real world brick and mortar businesses.</p>
<p>I'll discuss why WooCommerce will lose its dominance in a matter of years and suggests strategies that could avert the situation.</p>
<p>Intended Audience: Automatticians, WooExperts, WooCommerce contributors, WooCommerce plugin developers, WooCommerce integrators.</p>
