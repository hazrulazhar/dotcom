<p>After several hours messing with code and 1038482308483028 tutorials online, I finally got it! Behold!</p>
<p>Prayer Places Locater 1.0 (Alpha), Stable</p>

<p>My first proper RoR app. It's half done. I'll let you know when it's ready to launch. And I'll even write a tutorial here in due time for those developers that want to get a start on RoR. It's quite a fascinating language and framework. It has a lot of advantages over .Net and the Castle MVC framework. I find RoR far more simpler to utilise, although you have to get around the syntactical difference from your traditional OO languages like Java, C++ and C#.Net.</p>
<p>Ruby is just far more concise.</p>
<p>For example, the following in Ruby:</p>
<p><code>5.times { puts "i love you" }</code></p>
<p>performs the following in Java:</p>
<code>
<pre>
for (int i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {<br />
  System.out.println("i love you");<br />
}
</pre>
</code><br />
Ruby is just so..... how they say, "short and sweet".</p>
<p>But being an interpreted language has its lacks too. I know there are frameworks available like JRuby and Ruby/tk to write desktop Ruby apps, but how secure is it actually? I wonder.</p>
