<p>I've been invited as a Table Host and will be sharing my experiences as an entrepreneur, technologist and E-Commerce hero. I'll help answer your questions about business and entrepreneurship, the software engineer career and E-Commerce insights. Feel free to give me an elevator pitch. Alongside me will be my wife, who is also invited as a Table Host, and she will be sharing her experiences as an educator, civil servant, and scholar. As a trained counsellor, she'll help answer your questions on the educational path you should take. You'll also get to listen to our panel speakers and my contemporaries, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/syakirhashim/?locale=en_US">Syakir Hashim</a> (<a href="https://skolafund.com/">Skolafund</a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liyanasulaiman/">Liyana Sulaiman</a> (<a href="http://www.gimmie.io/">Gimmie</a>).</p>
